Data and Reality
----------------

This book had a big impact on how I think about modelling data and what it all
means. The book gets very philosophical near the beginning and much more
technical towards the end. It explores different ways of representing data and
how they map to the real world, as well as the trade-offs those come with.

I found out about it from `Hillel Wayne`_.

Warning: The 3rd edition has been substantially rewritten and is naff. Make
sure you're reading the 2nd edition (available from that blog post).
